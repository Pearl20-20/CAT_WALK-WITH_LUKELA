INSPIRATION
Modeling in the fashion industry involves walking along a catwalk, turning to display clothes in front of an audience. The profession of modeling was initially established by Charles Frederick Worth in the 1800s. It has had a profound impact on my family, creating opportunities for my sister and daughter. My daughter, inspired by her aunt, has pursued her dreams in the modeling world, showcasing her talent on runways, working with renowned photographers, and even venturing into clothing design.
Modeling has significantly contributed to their self-esteem and confidence. However, like any profession, it comes with its challenges. Some promoters offer minimal compensation, and in certain cases, fail to provide payment after shows. This situation can create a stressful environment and a sense of time being wasted. Models often adhere to strict diets and exercise regimens to maintain the ideal physique for showcasing various clothing on the runway.
Furthermore, the modeling industry lacks privacy, especially during quick changes between outfits. Models frequently endure non consensual touching and uncomfortable, inappropriate remarks. These challenges present a difficult landscape, but my daughter handles them with resilience and grace. Witnessing her dedication and hard work in this demanding profession inspires me to offer continuous support and encouragement.


PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to offer aspiring models an authentic glimpse into the multifaceted world of modeling. It aims to present a comprehensive view, showcasing not only the glamorous aspects but also the challenges and complexities that come with a career in modeling. Through this project, I aspire to inspire individuals by using my sister and daughter as prime examples.
Their journeys in the modeling industry are a testament to the power of perseverance and consistency. I intend to demonstrate that with dedication and resilience, anyone can navigate and succeed in this competitive field. By sharing the stories of triumphs and tribulations, my aim is to motivate aspiring models to pursue their dreams fearlessly, knowing that they have the potential to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. Ultimately, this project seeks to instill hope and determination in the hearts of those aspiring to make their mark in the world of modeling.
